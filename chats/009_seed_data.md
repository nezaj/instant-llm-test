# Seeding Blog with Random User Profiles and Posts

**human** (Mar 12, 2025, 04:32 PM)

Alright my blog is fully functioning. As a last step I want to seed it with some test data.

Let's use the admin sdk to write a script that whenever it runs will

* Create a user with a random email following the pattern AdjectiveAnimal4DigitNumber@example.com (some examples: HungryHippo7823, FunnyDuck1235)
* Create a profile for this user with a handle similar to the email without @example.com (some examples: HungryHippo, FunndyDuck) and a bio that contains two random sentences expressing a positive, zen output on life
* three example posts that should be about 2-3 paragraphs long. Each post should be a creative poem or short story with a positive or educational message similar in vibe to Aesop's fables

In one transaction we'll want to create the profile and the posts, creating the correct links between user and profile and profile and posts

**assistant** (Mar 12, 2025, 04:33 PM)

 I'll create a comprehensive seeding script for your blog that uses the InstantDB admin SDK. This script will create random users with profiles and posts in a single transaction.

Let's create a new file called `scripts/seed.ts` that will generate the test data with creative content:

```typescript
// scripts/seed.ts
import { init, id } from '@instantdb/admin';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

// Initialize environment variables
dotenv.config();

// Initialize InstantDB with admin token
const db = init({
  appId: process.env.INSTANT_APP_ID!,
  adminToken: process.env.INSTANT_APP_ADMIN_TOKEN!,
});

// Arrays for generating random content
const adjectives = [
  'Hungry', 'Funny', 'Happy', 'Sleepy', 'Curious', 'Brave', 'Creative',
  'Gentle', 'Wise', 'Calm', 'Bright', 'Peaceful', 'Joyful', 'Energetic',
  'Thoughtful', 'Mindful', 'Sincere', 'Grateful', 'Humble', 'Friendly'
];

const animals = [
  'Hippo', 'Duck', 'Tiger', 'Panda', 'Dolphin', 'Owl', 'Koala',
  'Fox', 'Wolf', 'Bear', 'Eagle', 'Lion', 'Rabbit', 'Squirrel',
  'Turtle', 'Elephant', 'Giraffe', 'Penguin', 'Kangaroo', 'Raccoon'
];

const bioFirstSentences = [
  'Finding joy in the ordinary moments is my superpower.',
  'I believe every day is a canvas waiting for color.',
  'Life taught me that kindness is the greatest wisdom.',
  'I approach challenges as opportunities in disguise.',
  'My journey is about growth, not perfection.',
  'Embracing simplicity has brought clarity to my life.',
  'I'm a collector of stories and moments of connection.',
  'The universe reminds me daily of its abundant grace.',
  'Nurturing creativity has become my daily practice.',
  'I find wisdom in both stillness and movement.'
];

const bioSecondSentences = [
  'When not writing, I'm exploring trails and finding peace in nature.',
  'Every sunset is a reminder that endings can be beautiful too.',
  'The best days are those filled with laughter and learning.',
  'My goal is to leave each space better than I found it.',
  'I believe in the transformative power of deep listening.',
  'Gratitude is the foundation of my daily practice.',
  'Each breath reminds me to stay present in this moment.',
  'The journey inward has been my most rewarding adventure.',
  'Small acts of kindness create ripples of positive change.',
  'In simplicity, I've discovered abundance beyond measure.'

    `Long ago, in a forest where wisdom grew like trees, lived a ${adjective} ${animal}. Unlike others of its kind, this ${animal} approached life with unusual ${adjective}ness, seeing opportunity where others saw challenge.\n\nOne particularly harsh winter, when food became scarce and other creatures grew fearful and competitive, the ${adjective} ${animal} began to share what little it had. "Why would you give away your sustenance?" asked a puzzled fox. "Because," replied the ${animal}, "the wealth of community outweighs the poverty of isolation."\n\nAs days passed, inspired by the ${animal}'s example, other creatures began to share as well. Soon, the forest transformed into a network of mutual support. When spring finally arrived, the animals discovered that not only had they all survived, but they had formed bonds that would sustain them through all seasons.\n\nThe moral? Sometimes our greatest resource isn't what we possess, but our ${adjective} approach to life's challenges.`,
    
    `In the valley of Serene Waters lived a ${animal} known throughout the land for its ${adjective} nature. Each morning, the ${animal} would greet the day with gratitude, taking time to appreciate the dew on the grass and the song of the wind.\n\nOther creatures rushed through their days, too busy gathering and competing to notice the beauty around them. "You waste too much time in pointless observation," they would tell the ${animal}. "Life is about achievement and gain."\n\nThe ${animal} would simply smile and continue its ${adjective} contemplation.\n\nThen came the great drought, when the usual water sources disappeared. While others panicked, the ${animal} led them to a hidden spring it had discovered during its mindful wanderings. "Sometimes," said the ${animal}, "what seems like wasted time is actually wisdom gathering."\n\nAnd so the creatures learned that a ${adjective} approach to life—one that values awareness over constant activity—often sees what rushed eyes miss.`,
    
    `A ${adjective} ${animal} once lived at the edge of a bustling village. While admired for its ${adjective}ness, many villagers couldn't understand why the creature chose solitude over society.\n\n"Aren't you lonely?" a young girl asked one day, having wandered to the ${animal}'s home.\n\n"There's a difference," the ${animal} replied, "between being alone and being lonely. In quietude, I hear whispers of wisdom that noise drowns out."\n\nCurious, the girl began visiting regularly, learning to sit in peaceful silence with her new friend. Gradually, she began to notice things she'd never seen before: the intricate patterns of leaves, the colorful dialogues between butterflies, the subtle changes in the sky's mood.\n\nWhen she returned to the village, her insights brought fresh perspectives to problems that had long troubled her community. "How did you become so wise?" they asked. "I learned to be ${adjective} from my friend the ${animal}," she answered. "And discovered that sometimes, stepping back helps us see more clearly."`

}

// Main function to seed data
async function seedData(numUsers: number = 3) {
  console.log(`Starting seed process for ${numUsers} users...`);
  
  const createdUsers = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < numUsers; i++) {
    try {
      const user = await createUser();
      createdUsers.push(user);
      console.log(`Created user ${i + 1}/${numUsers}: ${user.handle}`);

      console.error(`Failed to create user ${i + 1}:`, error);
    }
    
    // Add a small delay between user creations to avoid rate limiting
    if (i < numUsers - 1) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
    }
  }
  
  console.log(`\nSeeding complete! Created ${createdUsers.length} users:`);
  createdUsers.forEach(user => {
    console.log(`- ${user.handle} (${user.email})`);

const numUsers = process.argv[2] ? parseInt(process.argv[2]) : 3;
seedData(numUsers)
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Seed failed:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Now let's create a `.env` file in the root of your project to store the credentials (if you don't already have one):

```
# .env
INSTANT_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
INSTANT_APP_ADMIN_TOKEN=your_admin_token_here
```

And let's also create a package.json script entry to run the seeding:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "seed": "ts-node scripts/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

To run the script, you'll need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ts-node dotenv @instantdb/admin
# or
yarn add --dev ts-node dotenv @instantdb/admin
```

Then you can run the seeding script with:

```bash
npm run seed
# or to specify number of users
npm run seed 5
```

The script will:
1. Create random users with emails in the format AdjectiveAnimal1234@example.com
2. Create profiles with handles like AdjectiveAnimal
3. Generate thoughtful, positive bios
4. Create three posts for each user with creative poems or fables
5. Link everything correctly in a single transaction

The content is varied and creative, with poems and fables containing positive or educational messages. The script also includes proper error handling and logging to track the seeding process.

 It looks like we're having an issue with the environment variables. The error is showing that the app ID is undefined. Let's fix the script to ensure it properly loads the environment variables and includes clear error messages for missing configuration.

Now create a `.env` file in the root of your project if you don't already have one:

```
# .env
INSTANT_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
INSTANT_APP_ADMIN_TOKEN=your_admin_token_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_app_id_here` and `your_admin_token_here` with your actual InstantDB app ID and admin token. You can find these values in your InstantDB dashboard.

You can run the script with:

```bash
node scripts/seed.js
```

The script now includes better error handling for missing environment variables and provides clear guidance on how to fix the issues.

 I'll update the script to create between 8-24 random posts per user. Here's the modified version:

```javascript
// scripts/seed.ts
require('dotenv').config();
const { init, id } = require('@instantdb/admin');

// Verify environment variables are set
const APP_ID = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANT_APP_ID;
const ADMIN_TOKEN = process.env.INSTANT_APP_ADMIN_TOKEN;

if (!APP_ID) {
  console.error("Error: NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANT_APP_ID environment variable is not set.");
  console.error("Please make sure you have created a .env file with NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANT_APP_ID=your_app_id_here");
  process.exit(1);
}

if (!ADMIN_TOKEN) {
  console.error("Error: INSTANT_APP_ADMIN_TOKEN environment variable is not set.");
  console.error("Please make sure you have created a .env file with INSTANT_APP_ADMIN_TOKEN=your_admin_token_here");
  process.exit(1);
}

console.log(`Using Instant app ID: ${APP_ID}`);

    `Long ago, in a forest where wisdom grew like trees, lived a ${adjective} ${animal}. Unlike others of its kind, this ${animal} approached life with unusual ${adjective}ness, seeing opportunity where others saw challenge.\n\nOne particularly harsh winter, when food became scarce and other creatures grew fearful and competitive, the ${adjective} ${animal} began to share what little it had. "Why would you give away your sustenance?" asked a puzzled fox. "Because," replied the ${animal}, "the wealth of community outweighs the poverty of isolation."\n\nAs days passed, inspired by the ${animal}'s example, other creatures began to share as well. Soon, the forest transformed into a network of mutual support. When spring finally arrived, the animals discovered that not only had they all survived, but they had formed bonds that would sustain them through all seasons.\n\nThe moral? Sometimes our greatest resource isn't what we possess, but our ${adjective} approach to life's challenges.`,

    `In the valley of Serene Waters lived a ${animal} known throughout the land for its ${adjective} nature. Each morning, the ${animal} would greet the day with gratitude, taking time to appreciate the dew on the grass and the song of the wind.\n\nOther creatures rushed through their days, too busy gathering and competing to notice the beauty around them. "You waste too much time in pointless observation," they would tell the ${animal}. "Life is about achievement and gain."\n\nThe ${animal} would simply smile and continue its ${adjective} contemplation.\n\nThen came the great drought, when the usual water sources disappeared. While others panicked, the ${animal} led them to a hidden spring it had discovered during its mindful wanderings. "Sometimes," said the ${animal}, "what seems like wasted time is actually wisdom gathering."\n\nAnd so the creatures learned that a ${adjective} approach to life—one that values awareness over constant activity—often sees what rushed eyes miss.`,

    `A ${adjective} ${animal} once lived at the edge of a bustling village. While admired for its ${adjective}ness, many villagers couldn't understand why the creature chose solitude over society.\n\n"Aren't you lonely?" a young girl asked one day, having wandered to the ${animal}'s home.\n\n"There's a difference," the ${animal} replied, "between being alone and being lonely. In quietude, I hear whispers of wisdom that noise drowns out."\n\nCurious, the girl began visiting regularly, learning to sit in peaceful silence with her new friend. Gradually, she began to notice things she'd never seen before: the intricate patterns of leaves, the colorful dialogues between butterflies, the subtle changes in the sky's mood.\n\nWhen she returned to the village, her insights brought fresh perspectives to problems that had long troubled her community. "How did you become so wise?" they asked. "I learned to be ${adjective} from my friend the ${animal}," she answered. "And discovered that sometimes, stepping back helps us see more clearly."`,
    
    `In a kingdom where everyone rushed from one task to the next, there lived a ${adjective} ${animal} who moved at its own deliberate pace. Other creatures mocked this ${animal}, calling it lazy and unproductive.\n\n"Why don't you hurry?" they would ask. "There's so much to do, so much to accomplish!"\n\nThe ${animal} would simply reply, "I'm not moving slowly; I'm moving mindfully."\n\nOne day, a great storm approached. While other creatures frantically prepared, making mistakes in their haste, the ${animal} calmly and methodically secured its home, gathered provisions, and created a safe shelter sturdy enough for others.\n\nWhen the storm passed, many had lost their homes to the wind, but those who sheltered with the ${adjective} ${animal} remained safe. "How did you know exactly what to do?" they asked.\n\n"When you move deliberately," the ${animal} explained, "you see clearly what needs to be done. Haste creates waste, but patience creates perfection."\n\nFrom that day on, the kingdom learned to value the wisdom of mindful action over the folly of constant rush.`,
    
    `There once was a river valley where a particularly ${adjective} ${animal} became known for its unusual habit of collecting colorful stones. Other animals teased this ${animal}, wondering why it wasted time on such seemingly useless objects.\n\n"What good are pretty rocks?" they would ask with derision.\n\n"Beauty has its own purpose," the ${animal} would reply, continuing its collection.\n\nAs seasons passed, a terrible sadness fell over the valley. The skies grew gray, the plants wilted, and all the animals felt their spirits dim. One evening, the ${adjective} ${animal} arranged its colored stones in a spiral pattern near the communal gathering place.\n\nAs moonlight struck the stones, they reflected light in a rainbow of colors that danced across the valley. Animals came from everywhere to witness this spectacle, and for the first time in months, joy returned to their hearts.\n\n"Sometimes," the ${animal} said quietly, "what seems frivolous in times of plenty becomes essential in times of sorrow. Beauty is not a luxury—it's a necessity for the soul."\n\nThe valley creatures learned that day that practical needs sustain the body, but beauty sustains the spirit.`

This updated script:

1. Generates 8-24 random posts per user
2. Creates a mix of published posts (80%) and draft posts (20%)
3. Assigns random dates to posts (from 1 to 100 days ago)
4. Uses a broader selection of titles, poems, and fables
5. Adds more detailed logging that shows how many posts were created per user
6. Adds a delay between creating users to prevent overwhelming the server
7. Reports the total number of posts created at the end

The script maintains the creative, positive content while providing much more variety. Each user will now have a robust profile with a mix of published and draft posts spread across different dates.
