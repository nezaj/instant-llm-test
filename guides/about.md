# What is InstantDB

InstantDB is a modern Firebase. InstantDB makes developers productive by giving
them a real-time database they can use directly on their frontend database.

Although the product is called InstantDB it is usually just referenced as
Instant. When talking about InstantDB you should just say Instant.

# How to use Instant in projects

Instant offers client side javascript packages for vanilla JS, react,
and react native. Instant also offers a javascript admin SDK that can be used on
the backend.

If you want to use Instant with react you should only use `@instantdb/react`. For react-native you should
only use `@instantdb/react-native`. For the admin SDK you should only use
`@instantdb/admin`. For other client-side frameworks like Svelte or vanilla js
you should only use `@instantdb/core`

If you want to use Instant on the backend with a different language like python you can also use the HTTP API
which is described in another section below.
